    <!-- We will use an h2 tag to enclose 
        the headers of our web page-->
    <h2>Image Summarizer</h2>

    <!-- next the web app as you can see has a
         title asking a user to choose a file 

        so we will create a new header tag h3 
        which we can write this in-->

    <h3>Choose a file or paste to upload.</h3>

    <!-- Next to make start making our web page interactive we need to implement a button
    a user can click to accept a file from our computer-->

    <!-- this may sound difficult but HTML makes this quite easy and 
    can be accomplished in a single line-->

    <!-- so we are gonna type out angle bracket input and type = "file" this will
    allow us to select and upload files next onChange is an event function which
    will be specifies to a handleChange which Kyle will further explain once we implement 
    this code into react but for now we can think of it as a button and when we press it 
    it will allow us to select a file from out computers-->

    <!-- lastly we can close off our input tag with /> to complete this line-->
    <input type="file" />

    <!-- now we can add some more text to our webpage
    we can make another header tag of h4 and we will write in Selcted image to 
    later show where our extracted text will go-->
    <h4>Selected Image</h4>

    <!-- Klyle is later going to show how we can extract the test of this file but
    for now I can show as a bonus feature how you can upload an image onto your web page
    
    -->
    <img src="lightbulb_115137.ico" class="App-image" alt="logo" />

    <!-- now we can insert a break line for spacing purposes and we will create a 
    button wich can be built through a pre implemented tag in HTML which is as you 
    would guess button and we will label it as convert to text-->
    <br />
    <button>Convert to text</button>

    <!-- sp because we want the next line of text we write on the web page to have the same 
    style as the "Selected image text we will keep out h4 tag and now write Extracted text in it"-->
    <h4>Extracted text</h4>

    <!--So when creating a new class name in HTML you want to use a div tag which will create a 
        generic container to group together the testboxes that Kyle will later fully implement in react
        
        Our project as you can see will need three text boxes so for now I will code
        three div tags with the className text-box and write filler text inside 
        for now-->

    <!-- also the p tag is very commmon in HTML and referenced paragraphs so if you 
    are writing text on your web page that is not a header you can wrap that text in
    in a p tag-->
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>{ Filler }</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Summary text</h4>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>{ Summary }</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Summary text</h4>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>{ summary }</p>
    </div>

    <!-- finally we will add onw last break line and that will conclude the 
    studcture of the HTML that we will later implement into our react app!-->
